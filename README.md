# Chocolate Sales SQL Analysis

## Project Summary

This project showcases an end-to-end SQL-based analysis of a chocolate sales dataset using *MySQL Workbench*. The dataset, imported from a CSV file, includes fields such as country, product, category, sales amount, boxes sold, and order date. Using SQL, we performed data cleaning, exploration, and aggregation to uncover business insights.

Key functionalities implemented include:

- Filtering and sorting using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY
- Multi-table relationships with INNER JOIN
- Advanced filtering with subqueries
- Summary statistics with aggregate functions like SUM() and AVG()
- Reusable views for analysis
- Indexing for query performance optimization

All SQL queries, their respective outputs (as screenshots), and the .sql script are included in this repository. This project demonstrates practical SQL skills applicable to real-world data analysis scenarios in retail or e-commerce.
